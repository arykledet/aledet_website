        &emsp; Hi, my name is Aryk Ledet and currently I'm an engineer working on research and development at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. I graduated college in 2019 with my B.S. in Electronics Engineering from Johnson &amp; Wales University and had the opprotunity to be involved in a couple of clubs/associations. From 2018-2019 I was the chair of the universities ACM chapter and  member of the VEX Robotics club where I primarily helped with the software development. I also had the opprotunity to work on a R&amp;D project with one of my professors where we developed a daughter card and controller for an FPGA dev board that turned the development kit into a small retro gaming console.
        <br><br>
        &emsp; Before going to university I attended William M. Davies Career and Tech High School and studied Electronics/Robotics Pre-Engineering as my vocation. While at Davies I participated in regional robotics competitions and recieved hands on experince building various circuits which gave me an amazing head start to most of my courses at university. Nevertheless, some of the best leasons I had while in high school were by friends I made online whom introduced me to Linux and taught me how to make Java plugins/mods for games such as Minecraft.
        <br><br>
        &emsp; My interests in programming &amp; electronics started when I was about 11, which is when I started trying to make my own video games using software such as GameMaker studio. I was inspired by game breaking glitches/exploits and wanted the liberty to have full control of my own games. Around the same time my parents were kind enough to save up enough money to send me to ID Tech Camp for a few weeks which fueled my interests even more (Thanks mom!). Today, I use my free time to volunteer for outreach programs such as Beaverworks and LLRISE who's missions make it possible for kids of all backgrounds to get introduced to STEM.
